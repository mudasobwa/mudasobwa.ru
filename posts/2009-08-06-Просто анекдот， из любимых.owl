So a Texan goes to Harvard and he is walking across Harvard yard when he sees a student, wearing his beanie, approaching. He stops the student and asks, ‘Excuse me, feller, where"s the library at?’ ⏎
The Harvard student, taken aback, responds, ‘Dear sir, here at Harvard we do not end our sentences with prepositions.’ ⏎
To which the Texan replies ‘Okay, where"s the library at, asshole.’
