Whether you’re cutting up honeyed luscious pie ⏎
trying to put youself in goddamn eternity, ⏎
or dividing by nil, calculating pi ⏎
with unlimited accuracy, reciting insanity,

you are lonesome here, forgetting superfluous words ⏎
forgiving void in the middle of crying festival.

Thanks to the gestures, I see gleams of splashing swords ⏎
in hands, holding crow quill to survive, to aestivate.
