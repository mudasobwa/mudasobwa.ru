〉 Spelunking through the Hardware Abstraction Layer while working for a certain Finnish Mobile Network Equipment Manufacturer I found 100+ occurrences of the Finnish word ‘puukko’. ⏎
A ‘puukko’ is an all purpose knife that every Finn has in their toolbox or around the house. It is used for everything from pealing potatoes to performing computer repairs (my observations). I believe in this context it is the Finnish equivalent of the word ‘Hack’. ⏎
My Finnish colleagues denied this and said it meant something more like ‘surgical procedure/intervention’… and I almost believed them until I found the comment: ⏎
/* Perkele ISO Puukko! */ -> Fucking Big Hack!
